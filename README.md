============================

A TDD guide using Roman numerals - with a twist

Found this useful as an introductory guide to testing in Python, updating for python 3. Not using Django so the author's more complete guide* was overkill for quickly getting up to speed on concepts and methods.

If you get to the end of chapter 3, you should be able to finish off on your own to have a pretty neat Roman Numeral calculator...
